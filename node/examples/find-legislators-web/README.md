# Find Your Legislators

At Phone2Action, we use VueJS for our frontend engine. Here, you'll find a scaffolded VueJS application with links to some resources you can add and develop for different funcctionality you may need. We've also included a sample API call to show you how you'd get legislator data from our Legislators API.

In order to use this, you'll need to know some NodeJS, and basic command line techniques. Feel free to stop by our booth to learn more about the technologies we're using here, or how to set up this example on your local machine.


## Project setup

This example requires some dependencies, which you can install with [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) or, preferably, [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install).

yarn install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development

This is the development server, which refreshes as you change and save files! 

```
npm run serve
