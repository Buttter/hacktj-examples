# We'll use the `requests` module to make our HTTP Request 
import requests

# We'll use the `json` module to format our response's data
import json

# Our Phone2Action API Key goes here
# Super important, we need this to show that we're authorized to make our request
x_api_key = '' # Should not be empty
# See the README for info on how to get an API Key

# First, we define our base URL and our parameters
# Our parameters can be a Dictionary, since the `requests` module converts them
# Our headers can also be a Dictionary, `requests` converts these as well
base_URL = 'https://fmrrixuk32.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/hacktj/legislators'
parameters = {
  'level': 'NATIONAL_LOWER',
  'address': '6560 Braddock Rd'
}
headers = {
  'X-API-Key': x_api_key
}

# Now, we're able to fire the configured HTTP GET request
response = requests.get(base_URL, params=parameters, headers=headers)

# Next, we convert the response to a JSON with `json.loads()`
representatives = json.loads(response.text)['officials']

# Finally, we pick out the data we want and print it to the console
# Use Postman to figure out what format your data is in and access it accordingly
# A sample JSON is also available at https://github.com/phone2action/hacktj-examples#legislators-api
