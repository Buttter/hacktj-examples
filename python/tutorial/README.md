# Python GET Request Example - Wikipedia API Request

## Instructions: 

Run `wikipedia_get_request.py`. You shouldn't need any external dependencies.

## Note: 

Python version 3 (or greater) is required; if you only have Python 2 installed, this code won't work. You can download Python 3.7.3 [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-373/).

Some systems have both Python 2 and 3 installed (if you have macOS installed, the default Python version is Python 2, and you can't remove it), and it's important to make sure that you're using Python 3. If you're using an IDE (like PyCharm) to run your app, it should give you the option to select Python 3. If you're using the command line to run your app, just call `python3 app.py` instead of `python app.py`.
